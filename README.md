A GPU-accelerated, AI-assisted sign language translator enabling real-time, two-way communication between the deaf community and non-signers. Built as a software-first system with a future vision of dedicated hardware, the project treats communication as empathy—amplifying expression, not erasing identity.
This project is a GPU-accelerated, AI-assisted live sign language translator designed to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between the deaf community and non-signers. The system translates sign language into text and speech, and live text into sign language, using computer vision, deep learning, and GPU acceleration to minimize latency and preserve the natural flow of conversation. At its core, the project treats communication not as a technical challenge alone, but as an act of empathy, care, and understanding.
The inspiration for this project comes from Japanese storytelling, particularly Tell Me That You Love Me, Heaven’s Coin, and Twinkling Watermelon. These series portray communication beyond spoken words—through presence, emotional awareness, and quiet support. Long before discovering these stories, my perspective was shaped in childhood by Doraemon. Doraemon was more than a cartoon; it was a philosophy. Doraemon never gave Nobita gadgets to hide his flaws. Instead, he gave him tools that helped him grow, teaching that imperfections are not weaknesses, but qualities that make each person uniquely complete.
This belief directly shaped my approach to this project. The deaf community does not need to be “fixed.” What they need is technology that respects identity and supports expression. Just as Doraemon’s gadgets gave wings to Nobita’s ideas, this project aims to give wings to communication—amplifying human expression rather than erasing it.
Due to financial constraints, the project is currently being developed as a software-based system, focusing on accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance through GPU-accelerated AI models. This software-first approach allows rapid experimentation, learning, and meaningful impact without access to specialized hardware.
The long-term vision is intentionally ambitious: to evolve this system into a dedicated hardware device that is portable, affordable, and optimized for real-time inference. This future device would enable seamless communication anywhere, without barriers or dependence on external infrastructure.
Ultimately, this project is built for the deaf community, guided by the belief that communication is not defined by sound or words, but by connection, care, and understanding
